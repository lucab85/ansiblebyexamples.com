# Live from FOSDEM 2025!

The open-source world never stops evolving, and neither does the enthusiasm of its community. This year, I had the privilege of participating as a guest in a live streaming session with **[La Brigata dei Geek Estinti](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5yquqmAAdbB9bPkUISRimA)** (BGE) during **FOSDEM 2025**, one of the most significant conferences dedicated to free and open-source software.


## A Unique Live Experience
FOSDEM has always been a meeting point for developers, enthusiasts, and professionals passionate about open-source technologies. This year, thanks to BGE, I had the opportunity to share thoughts and experiences in a dynamic and engaging live streaming session: **BGE On the Road 5 - FOSDEM 2025**.

Streaming live from the heart of the event, we discussed key takeaways, trends, and the vibrant atmosphere of FOSDEM. Being part of this discussion was incredibly rewarding, allowing me to connect with fellow geeks and tech enthusiasts in real-time.

## Topics We Covered
During the live session, we explored:
- The latest innovations in **open-source software**.
- The impact of **community-driven development**.
- The role of **automation, DevOps, and cloud technologies** in modern IT.
- Personal experiences and the importance of in-person tech conferences.

The session wasn’t just about technology; it was about the people behind it. FOSDEM 2025 reminded us that collaboration is at the heart of every successful open-source project.

## A Big Thanks to BGE and the Community
I want to extend a huge **thank you to [La Brigata dei Geek Estinti](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5yquqmAAdbB9bPkUISRimA)** for organizing this fantastic live streaming and inviting me to be part of it. Engaging with a passionate audience and discussing the future of open-source was an unforgettable experience.
